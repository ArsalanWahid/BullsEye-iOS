#Description

This is the awesome game of Bull's Eye where you can win points and earn fame by dragging a slider.

Your goal is to place the slider as close as possible to the target value. The closer you are, the more points you score.

Enjoy!

This is the sample app I developed credits to [raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/)
